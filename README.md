# 🌲🛠🌲️ Biome Generation MVP 🌲🛠🌲️

This is a directory for tutorial purposes to demonstrate how to make a biome in Minecraft Forge. This is minimum viable product (MVP)
This project represents a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), built to include only the basic features needed to make a single biome in a Minecraft Forge mod. As an MVP, it is intentionally kept basic and singular, with this sole focus being on using [GlitchCore](https://github.com/Glitchfiend/GlitchCore/tree/1.20.1) and [TerraBlender](https://github.com/Glitchfiend/TerraBlender) to successfully create a biome.

## 📜 Permissions & Modpacks

This is not intended for use as a typical mod. This is a tutorial directory, if you wish to use it like a mod, you are free to.
However, this is for development of mods and studying purposes. This takes biomes directly from [Biomes O' Plenty](https://github.com/Glitchfiend/BiomesOPlenty/tree/1.20.1).
It is also, for the most part, not my own code verbatim. As described above, the code is taken from [Biomes O' Plenty](https://github.com/Glitchfiend/BiomesOPlenty/tree/1.20.1).


This is not a finalized mod. This is minimum viable product (MVP) for education purposes only.and is being used as intention for helping modders, such as myself, and others.
